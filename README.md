A Shared Passion for Justice: Sarah Mitchell and Robert Chen

Sarah Mitchell and Robert Chen were married Saturday evening at Stone Barn Center for Sustainable Agriculture. Judge Margaret Wilson, a family friend, officiated.

Ms. Sarah Mitchell, 32, is a civil rights attorney at the ACLU. She graduated summa cum laude from Harvard University and received a J.D. from Harvard Law School.

She is a daughter of Mrs. Margaret Johnson and James Mitchell of Millbrook, Connecticut. Her mother is a former ambassador to France and her father is a retired federal appellate judge.

Mr. Robert Chen, 34, is a policy director at the Brookings Institution. He graduated magna cum laude from Yale University and received a Master's in Public Policy from Georgetown University.

He is a son of Mrs. Linda Chen and David Wong of Riverside, California. His mother is a board chair of Doctors Without Borders and his father is a former deputy secretary of the Treasury.

The couple met while both volunteering for a civil rights organization. They discovered their shared commitment to social justice and quickly realized they both dreamed of careers in public interest law.
